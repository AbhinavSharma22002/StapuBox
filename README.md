Venue Management SystemA robust Spring Boot application for managing sports venues, time slots, and bookings. This project features high-concurrency handling, external API integration, and full containerization.🚀 Quick Start (Docker)The entire stack (Spring Boot App + MySQL) is containerized. Ensure you have Docker and Docker Compose installed.Clone the repository.Run the application:Bashdocker-compose up --build
Access the API: http://localhost:8080Health Check: http://localhost:8080/actuator/health🛠 Technical ArchitectureThis project is built with a focus on Production Readiness and follows standard enterprise patterns.1. Concurrency & Conflict PreventionTo meet the requirement of preventing double bookings:Optimistic Locking: Uses a @Version field in the Primary base class to prevent race conditions during slot updates.Unique Constraints: Database-level unique indexing on slot_id within the bookings table acts as a final safety net.Transaction Management: @Transactional boundaries ensure data integrity across Venue, Slot, and Booking entities.2. External API IntegrationIntegrates with the StapuBox Official API to fetch valid sport codes.Resilience: The application caches sport data and uses custom ResponseWrappers to handle third-party JSON formats gracefully.Validation: All incoming venue requests are validated against the official sport list before persistence.3. Security & API DesignID Masking: Uses an EncryptionService to encode database Primary Keys. Users interact with encrypted strings (e.g., venuePk), preventing ID enumeration attacks.RESTful Standards: Implements clean URI structures:POST /venues/{venuePk}/slotsGET /venues/available?sportId=...POST /bookings⚙️ Profile ManagementThe application uses Spring Profiles to separate environments:ProfileTarget EnvironmentDatabase HostTriggerdevLocal IDE Developmentlocalhost-Dspring.profiles.active=devdockerContainerized Stackdb (Docker DNS)Automatic via docker-compose📋 Mandatory API EndpointsVenuesPOST /api/venues: Create/Update a venue.GET /api/venues/available: Search available venues by sport and time range (supports optional filters).SlotsPOST /api/venues/{venuePk}/slots: Add time slots to a specific venue.BookingsPOST /api/bookings: Book an available slot. Returns 409 Conflict if the slot is already taken.📦 Docker ConfigurationMulti-Stage Build: The Dockerfile uses a Maven build stage and a separate JRE runtime stage to minimize image size.Orchestration: docker-compose.yml manages the network and uses a healthcheck on the MySQL container to ensure the database is ready before the application starts.💡 Key Design Patterns UsedData Transfer Objects (DTO): Decouples the API layer from the Database layer.Converters: Specialized components to transform Entities to DTOs and vice-versa.Global Exception Handling: Centralized @ControllerAdvice for consistent error responses and HTTP status codes.Final Submission Checklist[x] Dockerization (Dockerfile & docker-compose.yml)[x] No Double Booking Logic (Optimistic Locking)[x] External API Integration (Sport Validation)[x] ID Encryption[x] Spring Profiles (dev/docker)
